Use LLM for predict standard LOINC code from lab source code

This repo is hosting code for the final project of CSE 6250 at Georgia Tech. The goal is to reproduce key results from the paper [Automated LOINC Standardization Using Pre-trained Large Language Models](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v193/tu22a.html)

There are two dataset that's required for this project: 1) the offical [LOINC](https://loinc.org/file-access/?download-id=476131) table, and 2) the [MIMC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/D_LABITEMS.csv.gz) Clinical Database 1.4. Proper registration and/or training is needed to obtain both datasets therefore they are not included in this repository.
